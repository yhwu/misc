## Serve

#### Fast sidespin to the elbow
- make opponent decide backhand or forehand
- fast and different spin takes longer time to read 
- sidespin, topspin, backspin, nospin
- return:
  - backhand, quick flip, more like block with a little top spin
  - forehand, step around a little, pull back a little, use body to do a fast loop
  - push back with side backspin
  
#### Very wide sidespin
- quick attack to open space
- sidespin, nospin
- return:
  - backhand, flip
  - forehand, loop kill crosscourt or loop block parallel

#### Long heavy backspin serve
- edge to edge
- fast or floaty
- topspin third ball
- serve to crosscourt, backhand attack
- serve to middle or forehand, forehand attack
- return: 
  - push deep or loop

#### Topspin to weak side
- target weaker side
- get ready to attach topspin return
- return:
  - backhand, forehand, loop
  - elbow, block

#### Backhand sidespin from forehand corner
- get ready to for backhand attack
- return:
  - forehand push, gentle touch parallel, dig crosscourt
  - quick loop

#### Bouncy backspin
- surprise factor
- heavy, no spin
- return:
  - smash, loop, quick and focused
  

## Serve return

The less I know about how much spin is on the ball, the more spin I should use. The more spin I put on the ball, the less I need to consider the existing rotation.  
-- <cite>Werner Schlager</cite>

#### Fast heavy backspin to forehand:
- push hard, expect attack
- loop hard  
As the ball is fast and loaded with backspin, it will bounce away and down from the paddle fast. Whether push or loop, one must engage the rubber by pushing or looping hard. Regardless, the return will be long, so expect attack.  
Normally, there is little time to prepare for a full loop, so the movement must be fast and compact. What I found helpful are, 1. since there is no time to drop shoulder or body, drop forearm to increase paddle travel distance, 2. use hip to generate forward and upward motion, 3. accelerate in full motion, 4. use more forward motion to engage the rubber, 5. it is crucial not to brush upward as doing so will fail to engage the rubber and the ball would go to the net.   

#### Heavy backspin serve:
- short: touch, dig, flick(use more lift)
- long: dig, loop(open-up, aim to elbow)

#### Heavy sidespin serve:
- short: touch, dig(adjust bat angle), flick(less lift, can be more aggressive)
- long: loop,	dig

#### Heavy topspin serve:
- short: flick, push/chop-block(require excellent touch)
- long: loop
		
#### No-spin serve:
- short: flick(light), dig
- long: loop, 50% power/spin

#### Long serve:
- backspin: step back, wait until initial drop, loop
- other: block, loop

## Difficult shot:

#### High heavy backspin:
- short: hit hard through, really commit
- long: compact, quick brush
This kind of ball is a trap. Normally people just hit and find the ball goes into net.

## Notes:

#### Grab the ball, engage the paddle, the key is acceleration.

> Whether it is for serve return, looping, or flipping, many coaches emphases the importance of grabbing, gripping, or holding the ball. However, when you ask how to do that, they tell you it's a feeling that is hard to explain and you have to practice a lot to feel it. Here, let's follow the trajectory of a ball, and you will see that the key is acceleration.

> The ball leaves your opponent's paddle, and you make a guess of its speed and spin. You swing paddle and the ball returns. In that process, the ball makes contact with your paddle, sinks into the rubber to a full stop, and then, the paddle push it back. It is when the ball stops that it is easiest to control. Your little tweak of wrist, finger, or arm is most effective and precise when the ball is still. In other times, when the ball is moving towards you, you tweak will be exemplified, just like some amateurs can't hit the ball to the same corner consistently. Or, when the ball is leaving you, you may fail to catch the ball or get a contact that is too thin to be effective, like what people called --- slippage.

> Now, we are at an instant where the ball is still. The paddle is moving, the rubber is releasing the energy it stored from the incoming ball, and these two forces act together through the rubber to accelerate and spin the ball. Quickly enough, the ball leaves the rubber and travels whatever trajectory that was determined by previous contact. However, our initial guess can't be that precise. Sometimes, you see people loop a ball pretty hard, but the ball still goes in the net, and then next time, they change paddle angle and the ball goes too high. If we want to return it where we want, we have to make some fine adjustments. But, since the ball leaves pretty quickly, we may not achieve what we want. It takes time to change a ball's direction and spin. In order for the ball to stay on the paddle, the paddle needs to be faster than ball, which means, you need to accelerate the paddle. 

> There are many expressions to describe the effect, like sufficient brushing, holding the ball, driving through. It all comes down to acceleration. A constant speed will only give you that much of time to work the ball. The faster the speed, the less the time in contact, and the more the error. If you want consistence, you need to accelerate the paddle to get more contact time to guide its trajectory. 

> Watching top players practicing, especially Timo Boll and Zhang JiKe, it looks like they hit a ball in three steps, pick up, carry, and throw. Acceleration is what they are doing.
